# Customer-Segmentation-Clustering

This is an unsupervised machine learning model. Here I used K-means clustering to visualize the different groups of customers in a mall. The groups being: people who earn less and spends less, earn more but spends less and so on. I learned how to find the suitable number of clusters for my model using WCSS function. I make short notes as I go along so feel free to check out the project.

happy learning ya:ll :)
